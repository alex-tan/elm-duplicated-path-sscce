Result:

```
Detected a problem.
-- MODULE NAME CLASH -----------------------------------------------------------

These two files are causing a module name clash:

    elm/B.elm
    ./elm/B.elm

They both say `module B exposing (..)` up at the top, but they cannot have the
same name!

Try changing to a different module name in one of them!
